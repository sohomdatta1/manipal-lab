## Lab 1

- **Question 1**: Write an ARM assembly language program to transfer a 32 bit number from one location in the data memory to another location in the data memory.
  - **Ans**: [this](./q1.s)

- **Question 2**: Write an ARM assembly language programt o transfer block of ten 32 bit numbers from one location to another.

  a. When  the  source  and  destination  blocks  are  non-overlapping(from  code memory to data memory)

  b. When the source and destination blocks are overlapping
  - **Ans for part a**: [this](./q2(1).s)
  - **Ans for part b**: [this](./q2(2).s) (not complete)

- **Question 3**: Reverse an array of ten 32 bit numbers in the memory.
  - **Ans**: [this](./q3.s)
