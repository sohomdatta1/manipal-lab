## Lab 1

- **Question 1**: Write a program to construct a binary tree to support the following operations. Assume no duplicate elements while constructing the tree.

  i. Given a key, perform a search in the binary search tree. If the key is found then display “key found” else insert the key in the binary search tree.

  ii. Display the tree using inorder, preorder and post order traversal methods

  - **Ans**: [this](./q1.c)

- **Question 2**: Write a program to implement the following graph representations and display them.

  i. Adjacency list

  ii. Adjacency matrix

  - **Ans for part a**: [this](./q2(1).c)
  - **Ans for part b**: [this](./q2(2).c)
